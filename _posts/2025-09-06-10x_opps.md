# 10X Opportunities 

Lately I've been obsessing over the Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule), which states that 80% of outputs are due to 20% of inputs. We often see this power law at play within investing. 

Take Herbert Wertheim for example, one of the greatest individual investors you've probably never heard of before. Wertheim has a $3.8B net worth, but here's what makes his story fascinating: the majority of his wealth comes from a single investment decision. 

In 1980, Wertheim invested in HEICO, an aerospace parts manufacturer, when most investors were ignoring small-cap industrial companies. Today, HEICO trades for $321. His original $5 million investment is now worth $3.2B. This single investment accounts for 84% of his net worth.

This is the Pareto principle in action. One decision created the vast majority of his wealth. But Wertheim's success isn't about picking stocks; it's about recognizing what I call 10X opportunities. 

## What is a 10X Opportunity?

A 10X Opportunity is any decision that can generate exponentially greater returns than conventional choices, whether measured in money, career growth, relationships, or life satisfaction. 

In investing, we see this clearly. Most portfolios generate 7-10% annual returns, but a single decision can deliver 10X, 100X, or even 640X returns like Wertheim experienced. 

But here's what most people miss: these same exponential opportunities exist in every area of life. The question isn't whether these opportunities exist. It's whether you can recognize them when they appear. 

## How to identify 10X Opportunities?

10X Opportunities are rare, but they share common characteristics that make them recognizable once you know what to look for.

**10X Opportunities:**

• **Challenge you.** They require you to become someone you're not yet.

• **Change your perspective.** They force you to question long-held assumptions.

• **Allow you to fail quickly.** Fast failure improves learning.

• **Push you into discomfort.** Discomfort grows into comfort.

These characteristics create exponential returns because most people avoid them at all costs. 

Opportunities with these characteristics provide 10X returns because they change your identity. Take, for example, the person who claims they can't speak in public because they are an introvert. When this person says yes to a 10X opportunity, their identity shifts from: 

"I can't speak in public because I'm an introvert."

To 

"I'm a public speaker."

It erases all doubt the person ever had because they were forced to be uncomfortable and fail quickly, which changed their entire perspective and the way they spoke about themselves. 

10X Opportunities compound. Once you see yourself as someone who takes action, you start recognizing and pursuing more bold opportunities. 

The question becomes: which decisions in your life deserve this level of intentionality? Some choices are too important for average returns. 

## Decisions that demand 10X Opportunities

Most people apply careful analysis to buying a car but wing their biggest life decisions. This backwards approach explains why so few people achieve 10X results. 

Some of these big decisions include:

**Where you choose to live**

You'll spend every single day here. This determines your career opportunities, professional network, cost of living, and quality of life. The difference between an average city and a 10X city can change the trajectory of your life.

**The people you spend the most time with**

You become the average of the five people you hang around most. Surrounding yourself with people who challenge and elevate you determines where you're headed. 

**Your career path**

Whether it's 40 hours a week at a job or building a business, this decision affects half of your waking hours. Choose something with leverage and growth potential; avoid selling newspapers in 2025.

**Your spouse**

This person will influence your life more than anyone else.

Most people optimize for comfort in exactly these decisions by choosing the familiar city or the safe career. But these are precisely where conventional thinking costs you the most.

Herbert Wertheim's $3.2 billion didn't come from daily stock picks; it came from one decision with 10X potential. Your transformational opportunities are hiding in these same major life choices.

The question isn't whether 10X opportunities exist. It's whether you'll recognize them when they appear.
