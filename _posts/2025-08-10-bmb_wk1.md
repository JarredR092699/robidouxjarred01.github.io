**You are going to die.** 

Our lives are like mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes (James 4:14). So how do we leave a legacy? 

**Psalms 90:12**
> *"Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom."*

Numbering our days is not about literally counting them; it's about making each day count. It's about living with the awareness that time is short and our choices have eternal consequences. 

Jesus reinforced this truth in the parable of the rich fool: 

> *And I'll say to myself, "You have planty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry." But God said to him, 'You fool! This is very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?' This is how it will be with whoever stores things up for themseleves but is not rich toward Go (Luke 12:19-21)*

To *Better My Brother*, is to invest in something greater. 
- Waking up early to meet with the God who gave us this very day. 
- Numbering our days so we can spend them on what truly matters - advancing God's Kingdom. 
- Building a community that makes an impact. 

### Why does this matter? 
Because the days are few.
Because eternity is real.
Because the mission of your life will outlive you.

### Reflection 
1. In what areas of your life are you still relying on your own strength instead of fully trusting God's plan? 
2. How can I take a practical step today to live with greater peace?
