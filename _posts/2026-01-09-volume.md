# Volume

Life is simply volume. 

In geometry, we learn that volume is the amount of 3D space occupied by a solid, liquid, or gas. But in life, we learn in order to fill that same "space", we must do more of it. 

Take for example public speaking. In order to get better, you must do more of it. Same thing applies for getting over a fear, or learning a new skill. 

The more reps you do, the more volume you fill, the better you become.
